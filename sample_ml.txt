Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence. Supervised learning uses labeled training data to train models. Unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data. Deep learning uses neural networks with multiple layers. Convolutional neural networks are excellent for image processing. Recurrent neural networks handle sequential data effectively. The backpropagation algorithm is used to train neural networks. Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used in machine learning. Overfitting occurs when a model learns training data too well. Regularization techniques help prevent overfitting in models. Cross-validation is used to evaluate model performance. Feature engineering improves the quality of input data. Training data should be representative of real-world scenarios. The learning rate controls how quickly a model adapts. Hyperparameter tuning optimizes model performance parameters. Natural language processing enables computers to understand human language. Computer vision allows machines to interpret visual information. Reinforcement learning trains agents through rewards and penalties.
